\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The facial authentication data flow on the smartphone can be divided into three
phases. TrustFA is the first effort that all three phases are secured.
Compared to prior works, the threat model regarding smartphone facial
authentication assumed in this paper is the most strongest. We leverage
TrustZone to guarantee the trust and freshness of data from camera and
accelerometer. In the future, people only need to focus on the first phase,
that is, how to more efficiently differentiate 2D flat photo from 3D user.
